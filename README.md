getting started

Appreciation of the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics group for putting together awesome materials for the data science track!
set up this account mainly because I'm taking their courses.
I'm supposed to write something about myself. oh no. I was awesome at math in high school, full score on Olympic Math Test. My peers thought I was a genius. My favorite color is matcha green. favorite book is Common Sense by Leung Man-tao. I paint, but I won't admit it if you ask me. ballet makes me feel peaceful therefore I love it. I play tennis and flute, not at the same time. animal lover, seafood connoisseur.
